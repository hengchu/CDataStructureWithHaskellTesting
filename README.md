# MyCDataStructures
Implementation of data structures in C checked by Haskell

----

This repository hosts a set of data structures implemented in C.

As an exercise to ensure code correctness, I am taking a different
approach to testing. Instead of writing unit tests, I am creating
bindings of the APIs to Haskell, and checking properties of these
data structures.

So far, I have linked list and red-black tree implemented. I'll keep
updating this repository.
